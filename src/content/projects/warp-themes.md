Warp-Themes was an innovative visual theme builder for the [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev), initiated in August 2022. Although the project showed great potential, it was archived just a month later due to time constraints in maintaining it.

What began as a whimsical idea, affectionately dubbed *Schnappsidee*, quickly evolved into a full-fledged project that even captured the interest of the Warp team. Developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI, Warp-Themes was deployed on Vercel and featured a live preview of a mock Warp terminal. This allowed users to see their theme changes in real-time, enhancing the overall user experience.

The application also included an installation wizard to assist users with theme installation, making it accessible for those who may not be familiar with the process. Additionally, a simple iTerm2 to Warp theme converter was in development, reaching an experimental yet usable state before the project was archived.

In September 2022, I embarked on my vocational training, which required my full attention and ultimately led to the decision to archive Warp-Themes. However, I am pleased to see that the Warp team has since taken the visual theme builder under their wing, incorporating it into their new [Terminal-Themes](https://terminal-themes.com/create-theme) platform.

As my primary operating system is not macOS anymore, my use of Warp has ceased, and further development of Warp-Themes is highly unlikely unless there is significant demand for it. 

For those interested in exploring the project further, the source code for Warp-Themes is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/trbndev/warp-themes).
