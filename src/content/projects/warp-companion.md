As a developer, I am always looking for ways to enhance productivity and streamline workflows. One of my notable projects is **Warp-Companion**, an extension designed for Visual Studio Code that synchronizes your currently selected color theme with [Warp](https://warp.dev/).

## Overview

Warp-Companion was developed as a companion tool to Warp-Themes, allowing users to maintain a cohesive visual experience across their coding environment. The extension simplifies the process of theme synchronization, making it easy for developers to switch between themes in VS Code and Warp without any hassle.

## Inspiration and Functionality

The idea for Warp-Companion was heavily inspired by the [iTerm2 Theme Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tusaeff.vscode-iterm2-theme-sync), a tool I personally used for a long time. The extension works by opening a custom WebView that captures the current color theme and updates the Warp Theme configuration file via a proxy. This seamless integration allows users to change their themes effortlessly.

## Current Status

As of September 2022, Warp-Companion has been archived due to a lack of time for maintenance. However, it remains a valuable tool for those looking to synchronize their themes between VS Code and Warp.
